Positioning tooltips (_but also dropdowns, popovers, and more_) is difficult.
**Popper** is here to help!

Given a reference element (such as a button) and a tooltip element, Popper will
automatically put your tooltip in the right place next to the button.

### Why Popper?

Naive tooltip implementations generally don't consider the following:

- Preventing overflow when the tooltip is near a boundary (e.g. `window`), it
  will get cut off;
- Flipping to keep the tooltip visible in the viewport for the user;
- Keeping the tooltip with the reference element when inside a scrolling
  container;

Popper solves all of these key problems in an elegant, performant manner. It is
a ~3 kB library that aims to provide a reliable and extensible positioning
engine you can use to ensure all your popper elements are positioned in the
right place. Why waste your time writing your own logic every time you are
programming a tooltip? There are many edge cases that are easy to forget to
consider, which is why we've done the hard work for you.

This library can position any pair of elements in your document without needing
to alter the DOM in any way. It doesn't matter if your elements are not close to
each other or are in two different scrolling containers, they will always end up
in the right position.

Since we write UIs using powerful abstraction libraries such as React or Angular
nowadays, you'll also be glad to know Popper can fully integrate with them and
be a good citizen together with your other components. Check out
[`react-popper`](https://github.com/FezVrasta/react-popper) for the official
Popper wrapper for React.

## Installation

### 1. Package Manager

```bash
# With Yarn
yarn add @popperjs/core@next

# With npm
npm i @popperjs/core@next
```

### 2. CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@popperjs/core@next"></script>
```

### 3. Direct Download

Manually downloading the library is not recommended because you lose versioning
management that the unpkg CDN or npm/Yarn provide.

You don't receive fix/feat updates easily and will lag behind the website
documentation, among other issues, and this quickly becomes an unmaintainable
way to manage dependencies.

## Usage

Popper has the ability to work as a plug n' play library with all features
included, as well as a tree-shakable library that minimizes bundle size if you
import only what you need.

### CDN

Generally, for CDN users, you'll be using the fully-featured `umd` file:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@popperjs/core@next"></script>
<script>
  // Now the script is loaded, you can use the `createPopper` function!
</script>
```

Importing features you need comes at the cost of extra HTTP requests which is
usually not worth it.

### Module Bundlers

For users of module bundlers like webpack or Rollup, you're going to want to
take advantage of tree-shaking in your bundler. This comes at the cost of extra
setup, but is worth it.

In your app, you can do the following:

```js
// Import the generator function
import { popperGenerator } from '@popperjs/core';

// Import the features you need
import {
  computeStyles,
  applyStyles,
  detectOverflow,
  preventOverflow,
} from '@popperjs/core/lib/modifiers';

// Setup Popper's default modifiers for each new instance
const createPopper = popperGenerator({
  defaultModifiers: [
    detectOverflow,
    preventOverflow,
    computeStyles,
    applyStyles,
  ],
});
```

Now you can use the `createPopper` function to instantiate poppers with _only_
the features you want. For instance, we aren't using the `arrow`, `flip`, or
`offset` modifiers, because the current component, route, or our entire app does
not need them. This lets us save on bundle size bytes for our users!

If you don't want to bother with tree-shaking and don't need bundle size cost
advantages, you can import the fully featured `esm` file:

```js
// All features included!
import { createPopper } from '@popperjs/core/lib/popper';
```

### Instantiation

Creating a popper instance is done by passing the reference element (such as a
button), the popper element (such as a tooltip), and some options to the
`Popper` constructor:

```js
// Get your elements
const element = document.querySelector('#button');
const popper = document.querySelector('#tooltip');

// Let Popper do the magic!
createPopper(element, popper, { placement: 'right' });
```

## Distribution targets

Popper is distributed in 3 different versions, in 3 different file formats.

The 3 file formats are:

- `esm` (works with `import` syntax â€” **recommended**)
- `umd` (works with `<script>` tags or RequireJS)
- `cjs` (works with `require()` syntax)

The 3 versions are:

- `popper`: includes all the modifiers (features) in one file (**default for
  `umd`**);
- `popper-lite`: includes only the minimum amount of modifiers to provide the
  basic functionality;
- `popper-base`: doesn't include any modifier, you must import them separately
  (**default for `esm` and `cjs`**);

Below you can find the size of each version, minified and compressed with the
[Brotli compression algorithm](https://medium.com/groww-engineering/enable-brotli-compression-in-webpack-with-fallback-to-gzip-397a57cf9fc6):

## Hacking the library

If you want to play with the library, implement new features, fix a bug you
found, or simply experiment with it, this section is for you!

First of all, make sure to have
[Yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install).

Install the development dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

And run the development environment:

```
yarn dev
```

Then, simply open one the development server web page:

```
# macOS and Linux
open localhost:5000

# Windows
start localhost:5000
```

From there, you can open any of the examples (`.html` files) to fiddle with
them.

Now any change you will made to the source code, will be automatically compiled,
you just need to refresh the page.

If the page is not working properly, try to go in _"Developer Tools >
Application > Clear storage"_ and click on "_Clear site data_".  
To run the examples you need a browser with
[JavaScript modules via script tag support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module).

## Test Suite

Popper is currently tested with unit tests, and functional tests. Both of them
are run by Jest.

### Unit Tests

The unit tests use JSDOM to provide a primitive document object API, they are
used to ensure the utility functions behave as expected in isolation.

### Functional Tests

The functional tests run with Puppeteer, to take advantage of a complete browser
environment. They are currently running on Chromium, and Firefox.

You can run them with `yarn test:functional`. Set the `PUPPETEER_BROWSER`
environment variable to `firefox` to run them on the Mozilla browser.

The assertions are written in form of image snapshots, so that it's easy to
assert for the correct Popper behavior without having to write a lot of offsets
comparisons manually.

You can mark a `*.test.js` file to run in the Puppeteer environment by
prepending a `@jest-environment puppeteer` JSDoc comment to the interested file.

Here's an example of a basic functional test:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment puppeteer
 * @flow
 */
import { screenshot } from '../utils/puppeteer.js';

it('should position the popper on the right', async () => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(`${TEST_URL}/basic.html`);

  expect(await screenshot(page)).toMatchImageSnapshot();
});
```

You can find the complete
[`jest-puppeteer` documentation here](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer#api),
and the
[`jest-image-snapshot` documentation here](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot#%EF%B8%8F-api).
